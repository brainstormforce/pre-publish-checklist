Is the fear of publishing an incomplete post haunting you already? Do you get worried about tasks like adding a featured image, updating the permalink, etc. just when you are about to click the publish button?

All of this is handled with an easy to use Pre-Publish Checklist plugin that lets you create a checklist you wish to maintain for every post type on your website. You can build a checklist with necessary tasks and prioritize them by placing them in the required order.

This will make sure that you are reminded of the remaining tasks before the post goes live.

== Key Features of Pre-Publish Checklist: ==

The Pre-Publish Checklist is a useful plugin that lets you monitor whether the posts, pages and custom post types on your website are complete.

With this plugin you can -

- `Manage a checklist for your pages, posts, custom post types, etc.` - The plugin fetches all of them in the settings and you can select where you wish to add the checklist.

- `Create dedicated and personalized checklists for each of them` - You can choose to create different checklists for pages, posts, etc. depending on the design and needs.

- `Overview the progress of posts and pages` - You no longer need to open the post or page editor to see whether a checklist is completed. We have added a column that can be seen alongside the list of posts and pages that will tell you whether a checklist is completed, how many items left or if a checklist isnâ€™t added for a particular post type.

== How does it work? ==
	
The Pre-Publish Checklist plugin lets you create a checklist and enable on the specific post types you wish to have it applied to.

You can select the message that should be displayed to users when they click on the publish button without completing everything mentioned in the checklist.

A pre-publish meta box gets added to the post types that you've selected and the plugin does its job every time you click the publish button without completing the checklist.

Here are the points in brief -

1. Under the General settings tab, select the action you wish to trigger when user clicks on the publish button.
2. Select the post types you wish to get this applicable to.
3. Create a checklist under the Checklist tab and save!
